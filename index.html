A common example are wireless security cameras, which have a default username and password. These are publicly available online for the different manufacturers and models. Most people don't bother changing these default settings, leaving them vulnerable to brute force attacks of their security monitors.</td>

The threat actor intercepts network packets and can interrogate the contents (this is known as packet sniffing). The threat actor's system masks as the IP of the recipient, so the network traffic is diverted to them. To remain undetected, they can choose to allow the traffic to continue on to it's intended address.</td>

Each packet can take an entirely different route to all the other packets. This enables packets to be sent quickly in contrast to a large file being sent via a single route. These routes can be intercepted, making the packets vulnerable to being accessed and their contents read. This is called packet sniffing.</td>
